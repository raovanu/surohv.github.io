hotspot-desc: The tentacles' pads are an array of objects pathed to a curve, their scale tapered with the same curve profile as the tentacles themselves.
description: An Awakener's Orb from Path of Exile, designed as a pendant for a necklace. To not introduce any inorganic geometry, I designed the hook into the model's tentacles themselves. Although the printed product doesn't convey every detail of the tentacle pads, I am more than happy with how it turned out.
