description: Valorant "Gunbuddy" keychains. Based on a few characters' signature ornaments, I designed, printed, and painted keychains as gifts. This was a fun project since each of them have a radically different style - Jett's flowing knife, Cypher's iconic hat, Sova's more organically shaped owl, and Phoenix's angular emblem.
